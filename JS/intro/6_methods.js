/*
Methods
Remember that methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with a period (the dot operator), the name of the method,
and opening and closing parentheses: e.g. 'example string'.methodName().

Does that syntax look a little familiar? When we use console.log() weâ€™re calling the .log() method on the console object.

console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
