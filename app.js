// #### app.js ####
// the starting point
// whenever we run a nodeJS application, our program is gonna look into this file first.
// whatever code is in here,  it's gonna run
// this is like our main file
console.log('Welcome to NodeJS !!!');

// whenever you typing JavaScript, It's just pretty much the code that runs in the browser
// unless you have a while loop or something it runs, it just completes and then it's done
// however think of this code right here as a code that gonna run on a server
// any nodeJS code gonna run on a server and it's gonna run continuously, so this process is going on, until we stop it
// all these code gonna run on your server side code

// Most of the web applications work with real time data and speed is important
// For applications like social networks which has a lot of requests coming in at once, nodejs is incredibly fast and efficient

// In nodeJS everything is a reference
