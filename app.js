// #### app.js ####
// the starting point
// whenever we run a nodeJS application, our program is gonna look into this file first.
// whatever code is in here,  it's gonna run
// this is like our main file
console.log('Hello! NodeJS');

// whenever you typing JavaScript, It's just pretty much the code that runs in the browser
// unless you have a while loop or something it runs, it just completes and then it's done
// however think of this code right here as a code that gonna run on a server
// any nodeJS code gonna run on a server and it's gonna run continuously, so this process is going on, until we stop it
// all these code gonna run on your server side code
